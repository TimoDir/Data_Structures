# ðŸ“‚ Singly linked list

(to be edited).

The Singly linked list I will code will containe in his constructor:

- a head who will be the first node of the list.

He will also have some Methode like:

- addToHead(data), who will create a node and set it to the Head of the list.
- removeHead(), who will remove the current head of the list.
- addToTail(data), who will create a node and set it to the last node of the list
- removeTail(), who will remove the current last node of the list.
- printList(), who will print each Node of the list in order
- removeNode(node), who will search and remove a Node of the list.
