# ðŸ“‚ Nodes

First on my list because Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of many computer science data structures. We will found them inside linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more. Nodes contain data and also may link to other nodes. Links between nodes are often implemented by pointers.

The Node I will code will containe in his constructor:

- Data.
- A Next pointer.
- A Previous pointer.

He will also have some Methode like:

- setNextNode(node), Who will set a Node inside the Next pointer of the current Node.
- getNextNode(), Who will get the Node inside the Next pointer of the current Node.
- setPrevNode(node), Who will set a Node inside the Previous pointer of the current Node.
- getPrevNode(), Who will get the Node inside the Previous pointer of the current Node.
